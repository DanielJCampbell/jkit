Icons
=====
The icons used in this application are sourced from two locations:

1) The OOO-icons library, which is licensed under the LGPL.  
   This includes all files com/simpular/frontend/icons/stock_*.png
   See:	http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/1637.html
	
2) The Java look-and-feel icons library.  This includes the file
   com/simpular/frontend/icons/Play24.gif
   See: http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/
	
As such, these Icons can be freely distributed with this program.  
However, you must abide by their respective licenses if you choose 
to distribute the icons as part of any other program/library.
